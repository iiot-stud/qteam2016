## Title: A policy engine for container orchestration

## (Executive) Abstract

## Introduction
<!--- introducing topic -->
With increased interest in cloud computing and operating-system-level virtualization containers, the topic of container orchestration also gained interest. When trying to orchestrate across cloud provider borders, one of the different challenges is, to decide, which nodes from which provider to use, in a given situation. 
<!--- accomplishments -->
We want to elaborate a policy engine which decides, which cluster nodes meet the demands of a given policy by its given constraints. In order to do this, we need to identify criteria, on which we can define a set of policies on. We also need to define an interface to connect with orchestration software. When given a set of policies to enforce, potential contradictory policies have to be resolved in some manner. Once having an implementation, some form of auditing is desirable, to make sure policies are enforced.
<!--- research area -->
Our approach requires research in the practice of container orchestration and on the topic of semantic web. A better understanding of container orchestration allows us to understand the underlying technology we build upon and adapt accordingly. Semantic web helps us defining and evaluating policies. Since container orchestration should work on the internet, a prototype implementation of our policy engine requires understanding of web architecture and communication technologies. When policies should model law, for example to ensure privacy, an understanding of this topic has to be established accordingly.
<!-- gap -->
We want to apply semantic web methods to support container orchestration in enforcing policies, in particular using privacy laws as an example.
