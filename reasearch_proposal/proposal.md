## Title: A policy engine for container orchestration

## (Executive) Abstract

## Introduction
With increased interest in cloud computing and operating-system-level virtualization containers, the topic of container orchestration also gained interest. When trying to orchestrate across cloud provider borders, one of the different challenges is, to decide which nodes from which provider to use in a given situation. We propose a policy engine, which decides on a set of given parameters, which cluster nodes fulfill the given constraints. `paragraph in work`
